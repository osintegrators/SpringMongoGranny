Granny's Addressbook with Java + Spring MVC + MongoDB
Install database
----------------
Install the database.
* Download MongoDB from [here](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
* Extract the tar ball to any directory. 
* By default mongodb uses /data/db/ as the directory where it stores all its files. So unless you are changing that you need to create a directory /data/db/ on your filesystem.
    * Note: You can change the default by simply mentioning the path while executing the mongod server as follows <code> sudo ./mongod --dbpath=/temp/</code>
* Start the mongod server by running the mongod executable. Note: You might need sudo access for this.
